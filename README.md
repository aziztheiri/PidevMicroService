⚠️ Sinister (Claims) Management Module
The Sinister Management module is a critical part of the Insurance Management System, designed to streamline the lifecycle of insurance claims—from submission to resolution. It ensures transparency, traceability, and efficiency in handling incidents reported by policyholders.

📄 Core Features
Claim Submission: Users can report incidents (sinisters) with required details such as incident type, date, location, and attachments (e.g., photos, documents).

Claim Tracking: Users and agents can track the status of a claim in real time (Submitted, Under Review, Approved, Rejected, etc.).
